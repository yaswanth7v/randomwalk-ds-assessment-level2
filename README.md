# RandomWalk Data Science Assessment

## Instructions:

1) Fork the github repo into your personal Github account and take a clone into your local system.

   Guide to Forking Github Repo: https://docs.github.com/en/github-ae@latest/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo

   Guide for cloning Github Repo: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

2) Intantiate a Jupyter Notebook instance in the local working directory and create a notebook which answers the following questions.

## Questions:

Q1: Identify missing or incorrect data in the dataset and apply appropriate preprocessing steps to clean it (code and explanation)

Q2: What is the average body_mass_g for Gentoo penguins? (code)

Q3: How do the distributions of bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm differ between the three penguin species? Analyze the skewness and kurtosis of each feature for different species. (code and explanation)

Q4: Identify which features in the dataset have outliers. Provide the method used to detect them and visualize the outliers. (code and explanation)

Q5: Does this dataset contribute to the curse of dimensionality? If yes perform PCA. (code and explanation required)

Q6: Use bill_length_mm vs bill_depth_mm and plot 7 different graphs to visualize them. (code)

Q7: Find the maximum flipper_length_mm for each combination of species and island. Which species has the longest flippers on each island? (code)

Q8: Perform z-score normalization on this dataset. (code)

Interview Question:
I have solved the problem in cpp. Initially i have faced problem to figure out the spiral matrix algorithm and once i figured it out i just filled the values in the matrix with the 
node values in the linked list. If the node is null i replaced them with -1.
